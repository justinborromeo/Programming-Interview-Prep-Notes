# 6 Steps To Tackling The Coding Interview

1. Ask Questions About the Problem
- What edge cases do I need to handle?
- Do I need to handle invalid input?  Null input?
- What is the size of the inputs (e.g. is an array 10 elements or a trillion elements long)? 
- What if there's a tie (e.g. finding the string of longest length in an array)?

2. Define the Interface
- Method Name
- Input
- Output
- Do you need to create any classes?
- Note: this can be as easy as writing a function header

3. Define Test Cases
- Test the happy path (i.e. good input)
- Test edge cases (depends on how the interviewer answered your questions about edge cases)
- Keep tests small so debugging is relatively fast

4. Quickly Talk About the Brute Force Algorithm
- Show that you know the brute force algorithm in less than a minute
- Talk about why it's inefficient and mention its time and space complexity

5. Design the Algorithm
- Ask the interviewer to write pseudocode if the problem is of sufficient complexity
- Draw a flowchart if that helps
- Identify the algorithm's time and space complexity
- TAKE YOUR TIME, TALK AND THINK THE PROBLEM THROUGH!  This is the most important part since it allows the interviewer to see your thought process

6. Write the Code!
