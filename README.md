# Justin's Interview Prep Notes
## What is this?
These notes are meant as bite-sized summaries of an assortment of Computer Science topics for the intermediate programmer (~ 1st or 2nd year CS student).  They are a great way of quickly preparing (i.e. cramming) for programming interviews.  I'll try to add more topics as I learn more.
## I spotted an error!
That's great!  If you find an error, open an issue pointing out the error, indicate the corrections that need to be made, and provide a supporting resource (a photo of a textbook, Stack Overflow, documentation, etc.).  Alternatively, you can fork the repo, make the changes on your own repo, then create a PR (with the supporting resource).  I'll try to review the PR promptly and merge it into the main repo.  Please remember to spellcheck your changes before creating the PR.
## Want to see a specific topic?
If you want to see a topic that doesn't already exist in the notes, create an issue and let me know!
## Want to contribute?
For sure!  If you have notes that you believe would be useful for a programming interview, create a PR with the notes and I'll add them as soon as possible.  Please keep the notes concise (i.e. don't copy and paste large blocks of documentaiton), PG, appropriate for an intermediate programmer, and free of any typos.  Also, try to cover topics that are generally useful and not overly specific.

If you don't have a specific topic in mind, take a look through the suggested topics in the issues and see if there's any topics that you would be interested in writing about.
## Did you find these notes useful and want to show your support?  
The best way to show your support is to star the repo and let your friends know about it.  The more people who contribute, the better these notes will become.
