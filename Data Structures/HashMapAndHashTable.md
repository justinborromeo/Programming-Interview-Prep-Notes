# HashTables and HashMaps

## Implementation

## HashTables vs HashMaps
- HashTables don't allow null keys or values.  HashMaps allow one null key and null values.
- In Java, HashTables are [synchronized](https://github.com/justinborromeo/Programming-Interview-Prep-Notes/blob/master/Concurrency.md) and HashMaps are not.
